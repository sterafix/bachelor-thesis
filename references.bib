  abstract = {An ensemble of nanoparticles in which the inter-particle magnetic interactions are sufficiently weak shows superparamagnetic behaviour as described by the Ne´el–Brown model. On the contrary, when inter-particle interactions are non-negligible, the system eventually shows collective behaviour, which overcomes the individual anisotropy properties of the particles. At sufficiently strong interactions a magnetic nanoparticle ensemble can show superspin glass (SSG) properties similar to those of atomic spin glass systems in bulk. With a further increase in concentration, but still below physical percolation, sufficiently strong interactions can be experienced to form a superferromagnetic (SFM) state. SFM domains in a non-percolated nanoparticle assembly are expected to be similar to conventional ferromagnetic domains in a continuous film, with the decisive difference that the atomic spins are replaced by the superspins of the single-domain nanoparticles. In this review we highlight the most important developments in the field of supermagnetism, which comprises three fascinating subjects: superparamagnetism, SSG and superferromagnetism.},

  abstract = {Magnetic particle imaging (MPI) is a novel tracer-based in vivo imaging modality allowing quantitative measurements of the spatial distributions of superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) nanoparticles in three dimensions (3D) and in real time using electromagnetic fields. However, MPI lacks the detection of morphological information which makes it difficult to unambiguously assign spatial SPIO distributions to actual organ structures. To compensate for this, a preclinical highly integrated hybrid system combining MPI and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) has been designed and gets characterized in this work. This hybrid MPI-MRI system offers a high grade of integration with respect to its hard- and software and enables sequential measurements of MPI and MRI within one seamless study and without the need for object repositioning. Therefore, time-resolved measurements of SPIO distributions acquired with MPI as well as morphological and functional information acquired with MRI can be combined with high spatial co-registration accuracy. With this initial phantom study, the feasibility of a highly integrated MPI-MRI hybrid systems has been proven successfully. This will enable dual-modal in vivo preclinical investigations of mice and rats with high confidence of success, offering the unique feature of precise MPI FOV planning on the basis of MRI data and vice versa.},

  abstract = {Array programming provides a powerful, compact and expressive syntax for accessing, manipulating and operating on data in vectors, matrices and higher-dimensional arrays. NumPy is the primary array programming library for the Python language. It has an essential role in research analysis pipelines in fields as diverse as physics, chemistry, astronomy, geoscience, biology, psychology, materials science, engineering, finance and economics. For example, in astronomy, NumPy was an important part of the software stack used in the discovery of gravitational waves1 and in the first imaging of a black hole2. Here we review how a few fundamental array concepts lead to a simple and powerful programming paradigm for organizing, exploring and analysing scientific data. NumPy is the foundation upon which the scientific Python ecosystem is constructed. It is so pervasive that several projects, targeting audiences with specialized needs, have developed their own NumPy-like interfaces and array objects. Owing to its central position in the ecosystem, NumPy increasingly acts as an interoperability layer between such array computation libraries and, together with its application programming interface (API), provides a flexible framework to support the next decade of scientific and industrial analysis.},

The image reconstruction process requires a system function, describing the mapping between particle distribution and acquired signal. To date, the system function is acquired in a tedious calibration procedure by sequentially measuring the signal of a delta sample at the positions of a grid that covers the field of view. In this work, for the first time, the system function is calculated using a model of the signal chain. The modeled system function allows for reconstruction of the particle distribution in a 1-D MPI experiment. The approach thus enables fast generation of system functions on arbitrarily dense grids. Furthermore, reduction in memory requirements may be feasible by generating parts of the system function on the fly during reconstruction instead of keeping the complete matrix in memory.},

  abstract = {Purpose: Magnetic particle imaging (MPI) allows fast imaging of the spatial distribution of superparamagnetic iron-oxide based nanoparticles (SPIONs). Recent research suggests that MPI furthermore promises in-vivo access to environmental parameters of SPIONs as temperature or viscosity. Various medical applications as nanomedicine, stem cell-based therapies or magnetic hyperthermia could benefit from in-vivo multiparameter estimation by MPI. One possible approach to get access to functional parameters is particle excitation at multiple frequencies. To enable the investigation of the mentioned approach, a novel MPI device capable of multifrequency excitation is needed. Methods: MPI usually employs analog band-stop filters to cancel the drive field feed-through, which is magnitudes higher than the particle signal. To enable drive field frequency flexibility over a wide bandwidth, we propose a combined passive and active drive field feed-through compensation approach. This cancellation technique further allows the direct detection of the SPIONs’ signal at the fundamental excitation frequency. Results: A combined feed-through suppression of up to À125 dB is reported, which allows to adjust the drive field frequency from 500 Hz to 20 kHz. Initial spectroscopic measurements and images are shown that demonstrate the concept of multifrequency excitation and prove the imaging capability of the presented scanner. A mean signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) enhancement by the factor of 1.7 was shown when the first harmonic is used for measurement-based image reconstruction compared to when it is omitted. Conclusions: In this paper, the first one-dimensional multifrequency magnetic particle imaging (mfMPI) that features adjustable excitation frequencies from 500 Hz to 20 kHz is presented. The device will be used to study the principle of multiparameter estimation by employing multifrequency excitation. © 2019 The Authors.

  abstract = {Background: Magnetic particle imaging (MPI) is a new tomographic imaging technique capable of imaging magnetic tracer material at high temporal and spatial resolution. Image reconstruction requires solving a system of linear equations, which is characterized by a "system function" that establishes the relation between spatial tracer position and frequency response. This paper for the first time reports on the structure and properties of the MPI system function. Methods: An analytical derivation of the 1D MPI system function exhibits its explicit dependence on encoding field parameters and tracer properties. Simulations are used to derive properties of the 2D and 3D system function. Results: It is found that for ideal tracer particles in a harmonic excitation field and constant selection field gradient, the 1D system function can be represented by Chebyshev polynomials of the second kind. Exact 1D image reconstruction can thus be performed using the Chebyshev transform. More realistic particle magnetization curves can be treated as a convolution of the derivative of the magnetization curve with the Chebyshev functions. For 2D and 3D imaging, it is found that Lissajous excitation trajectories lead to system functions that are closely related to tensor products of Chebyshev functions. Conclusion: Since to date, the MPI system function has to be measured in time-consuming calibration scans, the additional information derived here can be used to reduce the amount of information to be acquired experimentally and can hence speed up system function acquisition. Furthermore, redundancies found in the system function can be removed to arrive at sparser representations that reduce memory load and allow faster image reconstruction.},

  abstract = {Magnetic particle imaging is a tracer-based imaging method that utilizes the non-linear magnetization response of iron-oxide for determining their spatial distribution. The method is based on a sampling scheme where a sensitive spot is moved along a trajectory that captured a predefined field-of-view (FOV). However, particles outside the FOV also contribute to the measurement signal due to their rotation and the non-sharpness of the sensitive spot. In the present work we investigate artifacts that are induced by particles not covered by the FOV and show that the artifacts can be mitigated by using a system matrix that covers not only the region of interest but also a certain area around the FOV. The findings are especially relevant when using a multi-patch acquisition scheme where the boundaries of neighboring patches have to be handled.},

  abstract = {This paper presents the first detailed simulation approach to evaluate the proposed imaging method called ‘magnetic particle imaging’ with respect to resolution and sensitivity. The simulated scanner is large enough to accept human bodies. Together with the choice of field strength and noise the setup is representative for clinical applications. Good resolution, fast image acquisition and high sensitivity are demonstrated for various tracer concentrations, acquisition times, tracer properties and fields of view. Scaling laws for the simple prediction of image quality under the variation of these parameters are derived.},

Until now, only dynamic 2D phantom experiments with high tracer concentrations have been demonstrated. In this letter, first in vivo 3D real-time MPI scans are presented revealing details of a beating mouse heart using a clinically approved concentration of a commercially available MRI contrast agent. A temporal resolution of 21.5 ms is achieved at a 3D field of view of 20.4 × 12 × 16.8 mm3 with a spatial resolution sufficient to resolve all heart chambers. With these abilities, MPI has taken a huge step toward medical application.},
